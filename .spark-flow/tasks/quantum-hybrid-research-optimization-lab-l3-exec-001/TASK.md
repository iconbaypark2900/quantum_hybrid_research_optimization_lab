# Task: quantum-hybrid-research-optimization-lab-l3-exec-001

## Description

L3 execution model smoke: liaison doctor + reporter closeout

## Human-in-the-loop rule

Each agent writes its phase result to:

`.spark-flow/tasks/quantum-hybrid-research-optimization-lab-l3-exec-001/outbox/<phase>.md`

The human reviews it and runs:

`spark-flow approve <phase>`

or:

`spark-flow reject <phase> "reason"`
